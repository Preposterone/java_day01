It is quite likely for different users to have the same name in the system.
This problem should be solved by adding a special field for a user's unique ID.
This ID can be any integer number. Specific ID creation logic is described in the next exercise.

Identifier
Name
Balance
*/

public class User {
	private Integer	Identifier;
	private String	Name;
	private Integer	Balance;

}
